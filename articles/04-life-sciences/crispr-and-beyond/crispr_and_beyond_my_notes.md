# CRISPR and Beyond: Personal Notes and Synthesis

## Executive Takeaways

The genome editing landscape in 2025-2026 represents a genuine inflection point. The approval of Casgevy validated the clinical viability of CRISPR-based therapeutics, while prime editing and base editing have matured from laboratory techniques into clinical-stage technologies. Several observations emerge from this research synthesis.

### The 11-Year Miracle Timeline

Jennifer Doudna's observation that going from laboratory to approved therapy in 11 years represents a "remarkable achievement" understates the case. Traditional drug development takes 10-15 years for small molecules with well-understood pharmacology. CRISPR required:

- Fundamental mechanism elucidation
- Safety profiling for an entirely new therapeutic modality
- Manufacturing process development
- Clinical trial infrastructure creation
- Regulatory framework adaptation

That all this occurred within a single decade reflects both the technology's power and the unprecedented mobilization of scientific resources.

### Prime Editing Has Quietly Become Revolutionary

The PERT announcement in November 2025 may prove as significant as the original prime editing publication. The concept of a single therapeutic agent addressing multiple unrelated diseases by targeting a shared molecular mechanism (nonsense mutations) inverts the traditional drug development paradigm.

Consider: rather than developing separate drugs for Batten disease, Tay-Sachs, Niemann-Pick, and Hurler syndrome, PERT potentially treats all four with one editing system. The efficiency implications for rare disease therapy are profound.

### Delivery Remains the Rate-Limiting Step

The consistent theme across every application domain is delivery limitations. LNP technology advanced dramatically post-COVID, but:

- Liver targeting dominates; other organs remain challenging
- Crossing the blood-brain barrier requires specialized approaches
- Immune cell editing requires ex vivo manipulation
- Repeat dosing raises immunogenicity concerns

The SORT technology achieving 16-37% lung editing efficiency represents meaningful progress but highlights how far we remain from universal tissue access.

### Base Editing and Prime Editing Will Eventually Displace DSB-Based Editing

For therapeutic applications requiring precise correction rather than gene disruption, base editing and prime editing offer clear advantages:

- No double-strand breaks (reduced safety concerns)
- Higher precision (single-nucleotide specificity)
- More predictable outcomes (no stochastic indel formation)

The 59% LDL reduction in cardiovascular trials and 43-90% correction efficiency in AHC models demonstrate therapeutic-level performance. As these technologies mature, traditional Cas9 editing may become reserved primarily for knockout applications.

## Key Numbers to Remember

### Clinical Milestones

| Metric | Value | Context |
| ------ | ----- | ------- |
| CRISPR trials monitored | ~250 | As of Feb 2025 |
| Active trials | 150+ | Ongoing recruitment or treatment |
| Base/prime editing trials | 15+ | Across five countries |
| Casgevy efficacy | 29/30 | Patients pain-free at 1 year |
| Beam LDL reduction | 59% | Highest dose cohort |
| AHC correction efficiency | 43-90% | Prime editing in mice |

### Technology Performance

| Technology | Metric | Value |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- |
| Base editing window | Position | 4-8 (protospacer) |
| LNP lung editing | Efficiency | 16-37% |
| LNP vs. electroporation | Viable cells | 4-fold more with LNP |
| Pathogenic variants addressable | CBE + ABE | ~96% of point mutations |

| Prime editing deletions | Maximum | ~80 bp efficiently |

### Cas Protein Comparison

| Protein | PAM | Cut Type | Key Feature |
| ------- | --- | -------- | ----------- |
| SpCas9 | NGG | Blunt DSB | Most characterized |
| Cas12a | TTTV | Staggered | Collateral cleavage |
| Cas13 | None (RNA) | ssRNA | Reversible, collateral activity |
| SaCas9 | NNGRRT | Blunt DSB | Smaller, fits AAV |

## Technology Convergence Observations

### The Epigenome Editing Frontier

CRISPRoff technology represents an elegant solution to CRISPRi's fundamental limitation. By installing heritable epigenetic marks, CRISPRoff achieves durable gene silencing without:

- Permanent sequence modification
- Continued expression of editing machinery
- Integration of foreign genetic material

This "hit-and-run" capability opens therapeutic spaces inaccessible to both permanent editing (too risky) and transient knockdown (insufficiently durable).

### Agricultural Applications Accelerating

The 2025 cassava disease resistance breakthrough exemplifies CRISPR's agricultural potential. Key factors driving adoption:

1. **Regulatory arbitrage**: No foreign DNA means simplified approval in many jurisdictions
2. **Precision**: Edits indistinguishable from natural mutations
3. **Speed**: Years faster than traditional breeding
4. **Food security**: Direct impact on smallholder farmers in vulnerable regions

### Diagnostics as Enabling Technology

The collateral cleavage activity of Cas12 and Cas13—a liability for therapeutics—becomes an asset for diagnostics. DETECTR and SHERLOCK platforms achieving attomolar sensitivity enable:

- Point-of-care pathogen detection
- Rapid outbreak response
- Low-resource setting deployment

This exemplifies how understanding mechanism enables identification of appropriate applications.

## Research Gaps and Open Questions

### Long-Term Safety Data

Casgevy approval came with ongoing monitoring requirements, but true long-term outcomes (10+ years) for edited cells remain unknown. Questions include:

- Clonal expansion of edited cell populations
- Late-emerging off-target effects
- Epigenetic stability of corrected cells
- Immune responses to edited cell populations

### Multiplex Editing Limits

Current clinical applications target single genes. Complex diseases or multigenic traits would benefit from simultaneous multi-target editing, but:

- Off-target risk scales with guide RNA number
- Delivery of multiple components increases complexity
- Unpredictable interactions between multiple edits

### Manufacturing Scale and Cost

Casgevy's ~$2 million price reflects:

- Autologous cell manufacturing (patient-specific)
- Complex ex vivo editing protocols
- Limited manufacturing infrastructure
- Small patient populations

Scaling to common diseases requires fundamental manufacturing innovation.

### In Vivo Editing for CNS Disorders

Neurological diseases represent enormous unmet need, but CNS delivery remains exceptionally challenging:

- Blood-brain barrier limits most delivery vectors
- Post-mitotic neurons require different editing strategies
- Large brain volume requires widespread distribution
- Immune privilege complicates repeat dosing

## Forward-Looking Analysis

### Near-Term Certainties (2026-2028)

- Additional FDA approvals for CRISPR-based therapies (likely hemoglobinopathies, rare metabolic diseases)
- Base editing and prime editing advance through clinical trials
- LNP delivery improvements expand accessible tissues
- Agricultural CRISPR products achieve broader market presence
- Off-target detection standards emerge for regulatory submissions

### Medium-Term Probabilities (2028-2032)

- In vivo editing for liver-targeted indications becomes routine
- Personalized editing therapies for ultra-rare diseases (following K.J. Muldoon model)
- Allogeneic (off-the-shelf) edited cell therapies reduce manufacturing complexity
- Epigenome editing enters clinical trials for cancer and other indications
- PERT or similar disease-agnostic approaches demonstrate clinical benefit

### Long-Term Possibilities (2032+)

- In vivo CNS editing achieves therapeutic relevance
- Multiplex editing enables complex trait modification
- Cost reduction makes editing accessible for common diseases
- Integration with cell therapy creates engineered cell products at scale
- Germline editing debate intensifies as safety improves

## Technical Deep-Dive Notes

### Understanding Base Editing Windows

The editing window concept is crucial for therapeutic design:

```math
\text{Editing Window} = \text{Positions 4-8 from PAM-distal end}
```

This means:

- Target base must fall within this range
- PAM position constrains which bases are editable
- Window can shift with different base editor variants
- "Bystander editing" of adjacent bases within window must be considered

### pegRNA Design Complexity

Prime editing guide RNAs are significantly more complex than standard sgRNAs:

```math
\text{pegRNA} = \text{Spacer (20 nt)} + \text{Scaffold (~80 nt)} + \text{PBS (10-16 nt)} + \text{RT template (10-50 nt)}
```

Key design considerations:

- PBS length affects efficiency (too short = poor priming; too long = reduced activity)
- RT template must encode desired edit with flanking homology
- Secondary structure can impair function
- Nick site on non-edited strand affects efficiency

### Collateral Cleavage Biochemistry

Understanding why Cas12/Cas13 exhibit collateral activity:

1. Target recognition triggers conformational change
2. Conformational change exposes nuclease active site
3. Active site remains accessible after target cleavage
4. Non-specific substrates (ssDNA for Cas12, ssRNA for Cas13) can access active site
5. Collateral cleavage continues until enzyme degrades or substrate depletes

This explains why:

- Diagnostics leverage amplified signal from collateral activity
- Therapeutics must minimize collateral damage
- Engineering efforts focus on decoupling target and collateral cleavage

## Synthesis: What This All Means

Genome editing has definitively transitioned from science fiction to clinical reality. The technology's trajectory suggests it will become as fundamental to medicine as recombinant DNA technology or monoclonal antibodies—transformative platforms that enable entire therapeutic categories.

The key insight from 2025 developments is convergence: multiple editing modalities (nucleases, base editors, prime editors, epigenome editors) provide complementary capabilities. No single approach optimally addresses all therapeutic needs. The field is maturing toward rational selection of editing tools based on specific requirements:

| Need | Optimal Approach |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| Gene knockout | Cas9 NHEJ |
| Single-base correction | Base editing |
| Precise sequence modification | Prime editing |
| Reversible expression change | CRISPRi/CRISPRa |
| Durable silencing | CRISPRoff |
| RNA-level intervention | Cas13 |

The remaining challenges—delivery, safety, cost, access—are formidable but tractable. Each has clear paths to improvement. The question is no longer whether genome editing will transform medicine but how quickly and how equitably that transformation will occur.
