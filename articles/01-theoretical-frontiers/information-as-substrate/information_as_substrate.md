# The Ontological Shift: Information as the Fundamental Substrate of Reality

The traditional paradigm of physics, which has historically prioritized matter and energy as the irreducible constituents of the universe, is currently undergoing a foundational revision. Theoretical frontiers across quantum gravity, thermodynamics, and biological complexity are converging on a singular, radical hypothesis: information is not a mere descriptor of physical systems but the fundamental substrate from which all observable phenomena emerge.

This shift, often characterized by the transition from "It from Bit" to "It from Qubit," suggests that reality is an informational process structured across nested temporal scales and governed by the preservation and transformation of coherent patterns.

## Historical and Philosophical Genesis

### Wheeler's Participatory Universe

The conceptualization of a universe built on information began with John Archibald Wheeler, who, in his later years, moved past the notions of "Everything is Particles" and "Everything is Fields" to the realization that "Everything is Information". Wheeler's "It from Bit" aphorism, presented in 1989, proposed that every physical quantity—every "it"—derives its existence and meaning from "yes-no" questions posed through acts of measurement.

In this participatory universe, the observer is not a passive bystander but an active participant who "crystallizes" reality from a sea of quantum possibilities. Wheeler argued that at the microscopic level, space and time do not exist as continuums; they are emergent idealizations that mask the discrete, information-theoretic source of reality.

### The Realist Counter-Argument

The "It from Bit" framework has been met with significant realist critiques, most notably from Julian Barbour. Barbour's "Bit from It" counter-argument posits that symbols like "0" and "1" are meaningless unless they represent concrete configurations of matter. Barbour asserts that bits are abstractions derived from the structured variety of the universe, which requires stable laboratory equipment and a low-entropy environment to be recorded.

This debate establishes the central tension in modern informational ontology: is information the "ontological basement," or is it a derivative of things?

## Comparative Ontological Frameworks

| Theory | Ontological Status | Primary Mechanism | Role of the Observer |
| ------ | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| It from Bit (Wheeler) | Fundamental | Measurement/Yes-No bits | Participatory; creates reality |
| Bit from It (Barbour) | Derivative | Configuration of "its" | Descriptive; interprets reality |
| Viscous Time Theory (VTT) | Primal Substrate | Coherence and Memory | Coherence resonance |
| Universal Information Framework | Substrate-Independent | Temporal Integration | Active interface across scales |

### Viscous Time Theory

Advancing beyond the Wheeler-Barbour dichotomy, the Viscous Time Theory (VTT) proposes a more substantial view of information. Raoul Bianchetti defines information not as a measurement artifact but as a primal agent—the "coherent potential to influence structure through memory across time".

In VTT, matter, time, and energy are emergent from local informational densities. Structure appears where informational coherence increases, and time flows where memory is held. This framework challenges the Shannonian reduction of information to mere bits per second, suggesting instead a "science of precipitation" where information possesses latency, inertia, and a measurable "residue" in the physical world.

## Universal Information Framework and Nested Temporality

The Universal Information Framework (UIF) extends the concept of informational primacy by proposing that reality is fundamentally constituted by information and its transformations, governed by computational rules that manifest as physical laws. Unlike traditional physics, which treats time as a single dimension, the UIF defines time as a continuous spectrum of nested temporal scales.

### Multi-Scale Architecture

Each scale represents a characteristic rate of information processing and transformation, where the interaction between scales occurs through integration mechanisms analogous to "gearing". This multi-scale architecture implies a scale-dependent causality:

- Processes at extremely fast rates appear as random noise to slow-scale observers
- Extremely slow processes appear as static structures to fast-scale observers
- Causality cascades through nested scales
- Effective degrees of freedom change depending on observation resolution

Classical reality, therefore, is not a physical mechanism but a resolution phenomenon where observers access information at specific temporal and spatial bandwidths.

### Nested Temporal Resolutions of Information Processing

| Scale Type | Characteristic Frequency | Information Density | Dominant Mechanism |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Quantum | Very High | Maximum | Entanglement/Superposition |
| Molecular | High | High | Chemical recognition |
| Neural/Sensory | Medium | Variable | Firing patterns/Integration |
| Ecological | Low | Distributed | Population dynamics/Coupling |

## Information Conservation as Fundamental Law

A central pillar of the informational substrate is the principle of information conservation. Theoretical models suggest that while classical conservation laws (energy, momentum, charge) may become ill-defined in certain contexts—such as energy conservation in expanding spacetime—information conservation appears to be a universally upheld principle.

Every physical interaction, from a photon bouncing off an atom to the neural integration of sensory data, encodes information about its causal history.

### Death as Re-Scaling Event

In this framework, "death" or "decay" is reframed as a re-scaling event rather than an annihilation. When a macro-scale system like a biological organism ceases to function, the information that constituted its "pattern" is not lost; it migrates to finer scales, persisting in molecular and quantum-scale interactions.

"Loss" of information is always scale-relative, meaning information that becomes inaccessible at one resolution persists and remains conserved at others.

### Consciousness in the Informational Architecture

Consciousness, within this architecture, is defined as the active process of cross-scale integration itself. It operates primarily in the 10⁻³ to 10² second range, continuously integrating fast-scale neural and sensory inputs into coherent world-models while projecting anticipations into slower-scale planning.

Meaning emerges from the recognition of patterns across these nested scales, dissolving the mind/matter dichotomy by identifying them as different scales of the same informational substrate.

## Spacetime as Quantum Error-Correcting Code

The theoretical frontier of high-energy physics has seen a profound synthesis of quantum information theory and general relativity. The "It from Qubit" collaboration, launched in 2015, has leveraged concepts such as quantum error correction (QEC) to understand the emergence of spacetime.

### The Holographic Principle

The core of this synthesis is the Holographic Principle, which suggests that the information content of a volume of space is encoded on its lower-dimensional boundary. This principle resolved the black hole information paradox by showing that information falling into a black hole is preserved in surface fluctuations of the event horizon.

The AdS/CFT correspondence provides a concrete realization of this principle, relating a gravitational theory in "the bulk" (Anti-de Sitter space) to a quantum field theory on "the boundary" (Conformal Field Theory).

### HaPPY Code and Tensor Networks

Recent breakthroughs suggest that the relationship between the bulk and the boundary is not just a mathematical duality but a quantum error-correcting code. In this model, bulk operators (physical objects in spacetime) are represented by boundary operators. If a portion of the boundary is erased or corrupted, the bulk information remains accessible because it is "protected" by the code's entanglement structure.

The HaPPY code (Harlow, Pastawski, Preskill, and Yoshida) serves as a toy model for this informational construction of spacetime. It utilizes a tensor network of "perfect tensors" covering a hyperbolic space, effectively implementing an encoding isometry where bulk inputs are mapped to boundary outputs.

### High-Energy Physics Informational Interpretation

| Concept | High-Energy Physics Context | Informational Interpretation |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Bulk | Higher-dimensional spacetime | The "Logical" information |
| Boundary | Lower-dimensional QFT | The "Physical" qubits |
| Wormhole | Einstein-Rosen bridge | ER = EPR (Entanglement) |
| Holographic Code | Spacetime geometry | Error-correction map |

### Complexity and Black Hole Interiors

The "It from Qubit" collaboration has also identified that the complexity of a quantum state—the number of simple gates required to prepare it—is linked to the volume of a black hole interior. As a black hole ages, its interior volume grows in proportion to the computational complexity of the boundary state.

This suggests that the "Big Bang" and the deep interior of black holes are problems of informational dynamics and the limits of quantum computational complexity.

## Thermodynamic Reformulations

A significant theoretical development in late 2024 and 2025 is the formal reformulation of classical thermodynamics in terms of information. Authors F. Barzi and K. Fethi argue that the traditional concept of entropy is ambiguous and should be replaced by the "information stored in a thermodynamic system".

### The Modified Ideal Gas Constant

This reformulation uses binary logarithms and introduces the "number of moles of information" (nᵦ) as a state quantity alongside energy. One of the most critical additions is the definition of a modified ideal gas constant R, which quantifies the energy cost of storing or retrieving information:

```text
R = kB × NA × log(2) ≈ 5.76315 J K⁻¹ molb⁻¹
```

This constant provides a direct bridge between the joules of energy and the "mole-bits" (molb) of information stored in a system.

### The Second Law Rewritten

Under this new framework, the Second Law of Thermodynamics is rewritten for a closed system exchanging heat Q at a temperature T_int:

```text
Δnb = Q / (R × Tint) + nbi
```

Here, nᵦᵢ represents an "intrinsic increase" in information due to internal dynamics, such as chemical reactions, which must be non-negative (Δnᵦ ≥ 0) for isolated systems.

This reformulation aims to demystify entropy by framing it as a manageable quantity of processed data, resolving confusion in systems where order and entropy appear to increase simultaneously, such as in the freezing of water.

### Information as Negative Entropy

The thermodynamic argument for the informational substrate suggests that information is the inverse of entropy—a measure of organized complexity. While the Second Law drives matter and energy toward maximum disorder, information operates under an "opposing principle" that drives toward maximum organization.

This is evidenced by the spontaneous emergence of increasingly complex structures throughout cosmic history: from atoms and molecules to life and consciousness.

## Informational Architecture of Biological Systems

Life is defined by its ability to process, store, and transmit information across generations. Biosemiotics, the study of signs and meaning in living systems, distinguishes life from inanimate matter by its dependence on material construction controlled by "coded symbolic information".

### The Material-Symbolic Distinction

This irreducible distinction between the "material" (laws of physics) and the "symbolic" (genetic code) is necessary for open-ended evolution. Biosemiotic networks, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and sensory systems, are multilevel and self-constructing.

They operate through "functional information," a set of signs that encode and control biological functions. The "Modular Evolution" model suggests that modules—basic units like proteins or organelles—behave as "intelligent agents" or "demons of information," using molecular recognition to self-organize and make predictions about their environment.

### Information Loss in Cellular Aging

Recent 2025 research using single-cell RNA sequencing has identified the "loss of regulatory information transmission" as a fundamental hallmark of aging. By measuring mutual information (MI) between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes (TGs), researchers found that informational flow systematically declines with age across all tissues.

The cause of this decay is primarily "input distribution mismatch"—a loss of coordinated TF activity—rather than "channel corruption" or the inability of factors to activate their targets.

### Aging Through the Informational Lens

| Aging Marker | Traditional View | Informational Substrate View |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Cellular Noise | Random stochastic fluctuations | Input distribution mismatch |
| Genetic Decay | DNA damage/Mutation | Loss of regulatory coordination |
| Function Loss | Worn out "parts" | Reduced mutual information |
| Rejuvenation | Repairing damage | Rebalancing informational nodes |

Importantly, in silico models suggest that upregulating a small set of key transcription factors can restore "youthful" information transfer, indicating that aging may be a reversible informational state.

## Origin of Life and Algorithmic Complexity

The spontaneous emergence of a protocell prior to Darwinian evolution remains a grand challenge in biological physics. Modern frameworks based on algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov complexity) highlight the formidable barriers to abiogenesis.

### Protocell Complexity

The complexity of a protocell (I_protocell) is not just the sum of its molecules but the shortest "program" required to specify its structural and dynamic organization. Estimates suggest that I_protocell includes genetic (Ig), structural (Is), dynamic (Id), and adaptive (Ia) information:

```text
I_protocell = Ig + Is + Id + Ia
```

The difficulty of assembling this structured information under prebiotic conditions suggests that life's emergence was either a highly improbable "miracle" of thermodynamics or the result of a "starter kit" provided by an external source.

### Directed Panspermia Hypothesis

Robert Endres (2025) discusses "directed panspermia"—the intentional transmission of microbes by advanced civilizations—as a logically open alternative, as it "outsources" the informational complexity problem. Regardless of its origin, once a minimal replicator emerged, Darwinian selection began selecting for architectures that maximized informational processing and energy dissipation.

## Consciousness as Integrated Information

The "hard problem" of consciousness is increasingly addressed through the lens of informational substrates. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0 identifies the essential properties of experience (axioms) and infers the necessary physical postulates its substrate must satisfy.

### IIT Core Principles

IIT argues that consciousness is "integrated information" (Φ), and its quality is specified by the set of informational relationships—the Φ-structure—generated within a complex of elements. IIT 4.0 introduces the concept of "Intrinsic Information" (ii), which measures the causal power of a system over its current state by multiplying its informativeness (uncertainty reduction) by its selectivity (concentration of power).

A "complex" is defined as a maximal substrate that maximizes Φ. Crucially, IIT emphasizes that consciousness is about "being, not doing"; two systems may be functionally identical from an external viewpoint but will not be phenomenally equivalent if they possess different internal Φ-structures.

### Postulates of Phenomenal Existence in IIT 4.0

| Postulate | Requirement for Physical Substrate | Mathematical Formulation |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Existence | Must have cause-effect power; take/make a difference | Non-empty TPM |
| Intrinsicality | Cause-effect power must be for itself, not for observer | Intrinsic information (ii) |
| Information | Experience is specific; it is "this" and not "that" | Specific cause-effect repertoires |
| Integration | Experience is unitary; cannot be decomposed into parts | Small phi (ϕ) > 0 |
| Exclusion | Experience is definite in content, grain, and border | Maximize Φ over substrates |

## Operational Coherence Framework

Beyond integrated information, the Operational Constraint Framework (OCOF) defines "interpretive intelligence" through five independent axioms: Boundary Integrity, Precision Structuring, Semantic Valuation, Policy Alignment, and Global State Continuity.

### From Computation to Interpretation

This framework distinguishes between simple computation (symbol manipulation) and true interpretation (assigning meaning). Meaning arises when a system reaches a "coherence threshold" or a state of "Meaning-Readiness".

This state is characterized as a structural phase transition where internal values and external signals are integrated into a coherent whole. OCOF is substrate-neutral, applying to biological, artificial, and hybrid cognitive systems without requiring phenomenological experience.

### Meaning-Readiness Axioms

| Axiom | System Requirement | Functional Role |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Boundary Integrity | Regulated information exchange | Distinguishes internal/external states |
| Precision Structuring | Signal reliability | Ensures information is not lost to noise |
| Semantic Valuation | Internal value system | Assigns "weight" to different signals |
| Policy Alignment | Action coherence | Connects interpretation to behavior |
| Global Continuity | Temporal stability | Maintains state across integration periods |

## Conclusion: Toward a Foundational Theory

The synthesis of research across these theoretical frontiers indicates that information is not merely a tool for scientific description but the very substrate of reality. From the "It from Qubit" perspective, where spacetime is a quantum error-correcting code, to the biosemiotic view of life as a multilevel construction network, the universe emerges as an information-processing system of immense complexity.

The reformulation of thermodynamics suggests that information has a measurable energy cost, and the study of aging and abiogenesis reveals that the stability and origin of complex systems are fundamentally informational problems.

### The Ultimate Goal

The ultimate goal of this research trajectory is a unified, foundational theory of information that accounts for meaning, value, and structure across all scales. As technology moves toward quantum-AI integration and biocomputation, the ability to manipulate the informational substrate directly—rather than just its material manifestations—may lead to breakthroughs in space travel, immortality, and our understanding of universal consciousness.

In the final analysis, the universe is not made of matter that happens to carry information; it is made of information patterns that, at our specific resolution, manifest as the vivid reality we experience. Reality is a participatory loop, a nested architecture of temporal scales, and a conserved flow of coherent potential.

**Information is the ground-state of the cosmos.**
