# My Notes: Information as the Fundamental Substrate of Reality

Personal reflections, questions, and connections emerging from the research synthesis on informational primacy.

## Initial Reactions

### First Impressions

*What struck me most on first reading:*

- [ ] The dissolution of mind/matter dichotomy through scale-relative information
- [ ] Spacetime as error-correcting code—the universe debugging itself
- [ ] Death/decay as "re-scaling" rather than annihilation
- [ ] Information conservation as more fundamental than energy conservation
- [ ] Aging as measurable information loss (and potentially reversible)

### Gut-Level Responses

*Raw reactions before analysis:*

## Key Insights Worth Preserving

### The Money Quotes

> "Information is not what 'rides' the physical wave of reality—it is the wave itself."
> "The universe is not made of matter that happens to carry information; it is made of information patterns that, at our specific resolution, manifest as the vivid reality we experience."
> "Death is reframed as a re-scaling event rather than an annihilation."

### Concepts That Changed My Thinking

1. **Nested Temporality**

   - Reality as resolution phenomenon
   - Different scales = different "realities"
   - Consciousness as cross-scale integration

2. **Meaning-Readiness as Phase Transition**

   - Structural, not mystical
   - Measurable coherence threshold
   - Applies to AI systems

3. **HaPPY Code / Holographic Principle**

   - Spacetime = quantum error correction
   - Bulk protected by boundary
   - ER = EPR (wormholes = entanglement)

### Personal Rating of Ideas

| Concept | Impact (1-10) | Confidence (1-10) | Priority to Explore |
| ------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Information Conservation | | | |
| Viscous Time Theory | | | |
| IIT 4.0 Consciousness | | | |
| Aging as Info Loss | | | |
| Directed Panspermia | | | |
| OCOF Framework | | | |

## Open Questions

### Philosophical

- [ ] If information is substrate, what is the "hardware" running it?
- [ ] Does this lead to panpsychism? Is all matter conscious?
- [ ] The "Russian-doll problem"—how do nested scales avoid infinite regress?
- [ ] If reality is participatory, who/what was the first participant?

### Scientific

- [ ] What experimental evidence directly supports informational primacy?
- [ ] How does entropy increase if information is conserved?
- [ ] Can Φ (integrated information) actually be measured in practice?
- [ ] What's the mechanism for information "precipitation" into matter?

### Personal

## Connections to My Other Work

### Knowledge Nexus 2026

*How does this inform the "year of absorption" framework?*

- Information architecture parallels knowledge architecture
- Nested temporal scales → nested learning hierarchies?
- Cross-domain integration as "consciousness" of the knowledge base
- SQLite vector search as primitive Φ-structure?

```text
[SPACE FOR ADDITIONAL CONNECTIONS]




```

### BEASTIQUE Project

*Conservation art through informational lens:*

- Endangered species = unique informational patterns at risk
- Extinction = permanent information loss at macro scale
- Gold/platinum renderings = preserving information in stable substrate
- Economic paradox → information valuation paradox?

[SPACE FOR ADDITIONAL CONNECTIONS]




```

### Sixth Mass Extinction Research

*Informational framing of extinction:*

- Biodiversity loss = decrease in biosphere's Φ (integrated information)
- Each species = unique "program" in the ecosystem's computation
- Ecosystem collapse = cascading information degradation
- Conservation = information preservation engineering

```text
[SPACE FOR ADDITIONAL CONNECTIONS]




```

### Terminal Velocity / Forensic Work

*Legal and investigative applications:*

- Evidence = information traces of causal history
- Audio analysis = signal-to-noise ratio optimization
- Case reconstruction = inferring bulk from boundary (holographic?)

```text
[SPACE FOR ADDITIONAL CONNECTIONS]




```

### Pylette / PySnip Development

*Code as instantiated information:*

- Software = executable information patterns
- Code quality = information coherence
- Documentation = meta-information preservation
- Randomized tools (Module Roulette) = information entropy injection

```text
[SPACE FOR ADDITIONAL CONNECTIONS]




```

## Application Brainstorming

### Personal Development

- View learning as increasing personal Φ (integration across domains)
- "Meaning-readiness" as threshold for mastery
- Sleep/rest as information consolidation periods
- Journaling as external information preservation

### Creative Work

- Music composition as information patterning in time
- Visual art as spatial information density manipulation
- Writing as symbolic information encoding
- Blade restoration as material information recovery

### Technical Projects

- Could implement IIT metrics in Knowledge Nexus?
- Information-theoretic code quality metrics for Pylette?
- Entropy analysis tools for system optimization?
- Cross-scale linking in database architecture?

## Further Reading Queue

### High Priority

- [ ] Original Wheeler papers on "It from Bit"
- [ ] Barbour's full "Bit from It" argument
- [ ] IIT 4.0 technical paper (PLOS)
- [ ] AdS/CFT and HaPPY code fundamentals

### Medium Priority

## Unanswered Tensions

## Quotes to Return To

### For Meditation

> "Reality is a participatory loop, a nested architecture of temporal scales, and a conserved flow of coherent potential."

### For Creative Inspiration

> "Structure appears where informational coherence increases, and time flows where memory is held."

### For Technical Guidance

> "Meaning arises when a system reaches a 'coherence threshold' or a state of 'Meaning-Readiness'."
