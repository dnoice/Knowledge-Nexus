# Fusion Progress: My Notes

Personal observations, insights, and forward-looking analysis from deep-dive research into the current state of nuclear fusion energy development.

## Key Takeaways

### The Momentum Is Real

This isn't hype. The convergence of multiple indicators signals genuine inflection:

- NIF achieved ignition multiple times with steadily increasing yields
- ITER construction is actually progressing with schedule/cost indices above 1.0
- Private companies have raised over $10 billion total
- First power purchase agreements are signed with real delivery dates
- Regulatory frameworks are emerging (NRC Part 30 decision was huge)

The "always 30 years away" joke is becoming obsolete. We're now talking about specific facilities with specific timelines and customer commitments.

### HTS Magnets Changed Everything

The high-temperature superconductor revolution deserves its own spotlight. This single technology advancement explains why the private sector timeline compressed so dramatically:

- 20+ Tesla fields in compact geometries
- REBCO tape manufacturing scaling up
- CFS proved the concept works at scale (September 2021 demo)
- Machine sizes shrunk dramatically (SPARC vs. ITER comparison is stark)
- Cost curves bend when you can build smaller

Watch the magnet supply chain. Whoever controls REBCO tape production at scale has leverage.

### Private vs. Public Race Dynamics

The private sector isn't competing with ITER—they're running a parallel race with different rules:

| Aspect | ITER/Government | Private Sector |
| ------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| Timeline | 2030s-2040s | Late 2020s-early 2030s |
| Risk tolerance | Low (taxpayer money) | High (venture capital) |
| Machine approach | Conservative, proven physics | Aggressive, novel concepts |
| Decision speed | Slow (international consensus) | Fast (executive authority) |
| Information sharing | Open (scientific papers) | Mixed (IP protection) |

Neither is "right"—they serve different functions. ITER advances fundamental science and proves physics at scale. Private companies take that knowledge and race to commercial deployment.

### China Is Serious

The China factor deserves careful attention:

- EAST broke world records in January 2025 (1,066 seconds H-mode)
- Estimated $1-1.5 billion annual investment (double U.S. government spending)
- CFETR roadmap targets commercial supply by 2040
- CRAFT facility represents massive infrastructure commitment
- Private sector (Energy Singularity, StarTorus) actively developing

The MIT Technology Review analysis was right: first-mover advantage depends on manufacturing scale and supply chain, not just plasma physics. China plays this game well.

## Critical Watching Points

### Near-Term (2026-2027)

- SPARC first plasma and Q > 1 demonstration
- Helion Polaris continued operation and efficiency gains
- ITER vacuum vessel sector installation progress
- NIF yield improvements toward 10+ MJ
- TAE Da Vinci development timeline clarity

### Medium-Term (2028-2032)

- Helion Microsoft PPA delivery (2028 deadline)
- CFS ARC construction progress
- ITER first plasma achievement
- China CFETR construction start
- Second wave of private company demonstrations

### Long-Term (2033-2040)

- ITER D-T operations
- Multiple grid-connected fusion plants
- Economics validation (cost per MWh becomes real data)
- Fleet deployment decisions
- Technology export and geopolitics

## Risk and Uncertainty Analysis

### Technical Risks Still Present

Plasma physics has surprised us before. Remaining uncertainties:

- Disruption mitigation at reactor scale (SPARC and ITER will test this)
- ELM control in high-performance regimes
- Divertor heat handling at commercial power levels
- Materials qualification under neutron bombardment
- Tritium breeding blanket performance

None of these are showstoppers, but each could delay timelines if problems emerge.

### Tritium Supply Constraint

This is underappreciated. The math is concerning:

- Global inventory: ~20-25 kg
- ITER D-T phase needs: 1-2 kg
- Half-life: 12.3 years (constant decay)
- Primary source: CANDU reactors (being retired)

Commercial fusion absolutely requires tritium breeding to work. The breeding blanket isn't optional—it's existential for the industry. ITER's blanket testing phase is critical.

Alternative fuel cycles (D-D, D-He3, p-11B) become more attractive if tritium breeding proves difficult at scale.

### Economic Uncertainties

We don't actually know what fusion electricity will cost. IAEA estimates ($5,600-8,000/kW) are modeled projections, not market data. Variables that matter:

- Learning curves in manufacturing (will they follow solar/battery patterns?)
- Magnet cost trajectories
- Operational complexity and staffing
- Regulatory compliance costs
- Fuel costs (minimal, but tritium handling isn't free)

First-of-a-kind plants will be expensive. The question is how fast costs decline with deployment.

## Future Scenarios

### Optimistic Case (2035)

- Multiple fusion plants operating commercially by 2035
- CFS, Helion, and one or two others delivering grid power
- Costs declining rapidly along learning curves
- ITER achieving Q = 10 validates physics for fleet deployment
- Fusion becomes obvious choice for new baseload capacity

Probability estimate: 25-30%

### Base Case (2040)

- First commercial plants operating by late 2030s
- Some timeline slips from current projections
- One or two technical setbacks requiring additional R&D
- Economics competitive but not dramatically cheaper than alternatives
- Gradual deployment alongside continued fission and renewables

Probability estimate: 45-50%

### Pessimistic Case (2045+)

- Major technical problem discovered at scale
- Disruption or materials failure sets back multiple programs
- Tritium breeding proves harder than expected
- Private company failures reduce momentum
- Fusion remains promising but perpetually 10-15 years away

Probability estimate: 20-25%

## Open Questions for Continued Research

### Physics Questions

- How do disruption dynamics scale from SPARC to ARC to fleet deployment?
- What's the actual operational lifetime of first-wall materials under sustained neutron flux?
- Can stellarators achieve comparable performance to tokamaks at reactor scale?
- Is hydrogen-boron fusion actually achievable at the temperatures TAE claims?

### Engineering Questions

- What's the realistic availability factor for a commercial fusion plant?
- How does maintenance complexity compare to fission plants?
- What's the actual supply chain capacity for REBCO tape at fleet scale?
- Can remote handling systems maintain fusion plants effectively?

### Economic Questions

- What's the minimum plant size for economic viability?
- How does fusion compete with advanced fission (SMRs, Generation IV)?
- What insurance/liability frameworks will apply?
- How do decommissioning costs compare to fission?

### Geopolitical Questions

- Will fusion technology become export-controlled like nuclear materials?
- How does fusion affect energy security calculations?
- What's China's actual fusion timeline vs. announced roadmaps?
- Will international collaboration (ITER model) or competition (private race) dominate?

## Investment Thesis Considerations

*Note: These are analytical observations, not financial advice.*

### What the Smart Money Sees

Major investors (Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Tiger Global, Temasek, Eni) are making large bets. They see:

- Technical risk declining (multiple approaches progressing)
- Regulatory clarity emerging
- Customer demand (Google, Microsoft, Nucor PPAs)
- Trillion-dollar total addressable market
- Defensive positioning against climate policy risk

### Concerns to Monitor

- Execution risk on aggressive timelines
- Capital intensity (these are expensive machines)
- Public market appetite for pre-revenue fusion companies
- Competition from advanced fission and geothermal
- Black swan technical failures

### Supply Chain Opportunities

Beyond the headline companies, value could accrue in:

- REBCO superconductor manufacturing
- Specialized materials (tungsten, RAFM steels)
- Tritium handling technology
- Power electronics for direct conversion
- Remote handling and robotics
- Specialized diagnostics and sensors

## Personal Assessment

After deep-diving into this landscape, my synthesis:

Fusion energy is genuinely entering its commercial era. The technical foundations are solid, the investment is substantial, and the timelines are aggressive but plausible. This is not the same "always 30 years away" situation from previous decades.

The most likely outcome is that at least one private company achieves grid-connected fusion power by the early 2030s, with costs initially high but declining as the industry learns. ITER will provide crucial validation at scale, and China will be a major player potentially ahead of schedule.

The wildcards are:

- Tritium supply and breeding (underappreciated constraint)
- Manufacturing scale-up (can you build 10 plants per year?)
- Unexpected physics at reactor scale
- Geopolitical disruption affecting collaboration

Watch SPARC and Helion closely over the next 24-36 months. Their results will set the narrative for the next decade.

## Research Backlog
