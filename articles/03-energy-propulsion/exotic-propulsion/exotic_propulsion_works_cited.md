## Notes on Source Quality

### Tier 1: Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles

Highest confidence sources with rigorous peer review. Classical and Quantum Gravity, Physical Review, and JBIS articles represent established scientific discourse.

### Tier 2: NASA Technical Reports

Official NASA documentation provides engineering-focused analysis. NTRS documents are publicly accessible and represent institutional positions.

### Tier 3: ArXiv Preprints

Preprints offer cutting-edge research but lack formal peer review. Useful for recent developments, but claims should be verified against published literature.

### Tier 4: Conference Proceedings

Conference papers vary in rigor. AIAA and IAC proceedings are generally reliable; specialized conferences may be less stringent.

### Tier 5: Popular Science and News Sources

Used for context and recent developments but not primary scientific claims. Includes Popular Mechanics, New Scientist, and institutional press releases.
