## Notes on Source Quality

All sources were accessed and verified between December 2025 and January 2026. Government and intergovernmental sources (DOE, IEA, IAEA, NEA) represent primary authoritative data. Industry organization sources (World Nuclear Association, ANS) provide expert analysis and aggregated data. Company sources offer direct project information but should be evaluated with awareness of promotional intent. News sources provide contemporaneous reporting and synthesis of complex developments.
