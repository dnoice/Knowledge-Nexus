# Altered States: Personal Notes

## The Convergence

What strikes me most about this field is the convergence. Pharmacology, neuroscience, contemplative traditions, and clinical psychiatry are all pointing at the same thing: the default mode network and its relationship to self.

This wasn't predicted. Nobody designed psychedelics to disrupt the DMN—they were discovered before we knew the DMN existed. Nobody designed meditation to do the same—it evolved through millennia of trial and error. Yet they converge on similar neural targets.

That's either a remarkable coincidence or evidence that we're onto something real about consciousness architecture.

## The Hype vs. Reality Check

**What's genuinely supported:**

- DMN disruption correlates with ego dissolution (robustly replicated)
- Psilocybin shows clinically meaningful effects in depression trials
- MDMA shows clinically meaningful effects in PTSD trials
- Long-term meditation produces measurable brain changes
- Set and setting profoundly affect outcomes

**What's overhyped:**

- "Psychedelics cure everything" narratives
- Ignoring the bad trip problem
- Treating mechanism as fully understood (it's not)
- Assuming subjective experience is necessary for therapeutic effect (unknown)
- Dismissing real risks

**What's underdetermined:**

- Whether the experience is necessary or just the neuroplasticity
- Why some people respond dramatically and others don't
- How long effects persist (follow-up data still limited)
- Whether recreational use has therapeutic value or is just confounding

## The MDMA Setback Matters

The FDA's rejection of MDMA wasn't scientific failure—it was methodological and oversight concerns. But the fallout matters for the whole field.

If MDMA had been approved, it would have normalized psychedelic medicine. Now every subsequent application faces heightened scrutiny. Psilocybin trials will need to be bulletproof.

The lesson: rigorous methodology isn't optional. The science needs to be better than the field's critics expect, not just as good.

## The Integration Problem

Here's what worries me clinically: integration.

Psychedelic experiences can be profound. But profound experiences don't automatically translate into lasting change. You can have a mystical experience on Saturday and be back to your old patterns by Tuesday.

Current protocols include "integration therapy"—sessions after the experience to help process and consolidate insights. But we don't really know:

- What makes integration effective
- How many sessions are enough
- Whether insights without behavior change are therapeutic
- How to handle difficult or confusing experiences

This is where the research is thin. We've focused on proving efficacy; we haven't fully figured out best practices.

## Meditation vs. Psychedelics: The Trade-offs

| Dimension | Meditation | Psychedelics |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Time investment | Thousands of hours | A few sessions |
| Control | High (you can always stop) | Low (you're along for the ride) |
| Integration | Built-in (daily practice) | Requires external support |
| Accessibility | Universally available | Legally/medically restricted |
| Ceiling | Unknown (possibly very high) | Dramatic but session-limited |
| Risks | Subtle, slow-developing | Acute, intense |

Neither is strictly better. They're different tools. The synergy research (combining them) is particularly interesting—maybe they're complementary rather than substitutes.

## The DMN Hypothesis: Strengths and Limits

**Strengths:**

- Explains commonalities across diverse altered states
- Neurally grounded, testable
- Unifies pharmacological and contemplative approaches
- Generates specific predictions

**Limits:**

- Correlation isn't causation—DMN disruption might be effect, not cause
- The DMN isn't the only network changed in altered states
- "Ego dissolution" is a subjective report, hard to operationalize
- Individual differences remain unexplained

I think the DMN story is true but incomplete. It's a piece of the puzzle, not the whole picture.

## What I'm Watching

1. **Phase 3 trial results** - Will psilocybin get FDA approval? When?
2. **MDMA's second chance** - Can Lykos address the methodological concerns?
3. **Mechanistic clarity** - Neuroplasticity vs. subjective experience as the therapeutic driver
4. **Adverse event tracking** - Long-term follow-up on risks
5. **Access expansion** - Oregon and Colorado as policy experiments

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Psilocybin remission rate (TRD) | ~50% at 6 months |
| MDMA response rate (PTSD) | ~70% no longer meeting criteria |
| Ketamine abstinence (AUD) | ~86% at 6 months |
| Meditation hours for structural brain changes | Thousands |
| Highly hypnotizable population | ~15% |

## The Philosophical Dimension

Altered states research isn't just clinical. It has philosophical implications.

If the sense of self is a brain process that can be interrupted, what is the self? If consciousness can radically reconfigure while remaining consciousness, what are its essential features?

These aren't just academic questions. They matter for how we think about identity, agency, and the relationship between brain and mind.

The materialist view—consciousness is brain activity, full stop—gets complicated when brain activity changes and consciousness persists in radically different forms. It's still consciousness, just not ordinary consciousness. What's constant across the variations?

I don't have answers. But the questions are real, and the data is accumulating.

## Personal Stance

I'm cautiously optimistic about the therapeutic applications. The early data is strong enough to justify serious investment in rigorous trials. The mechanisms are becoming clearer. The risks are real but manageable with proper protocols.

But I'm wary of psychedelic evangelism. These are powerful tools, not panaceas. They work in clinical contexts with preparation and integration. "Just take mushrooms and you'll be healed" is not what the research shows.

The DMN/ego story is compelling but not complete. We're early in understanding what these states are and why they help.

Keep watching. This is one of the more interesting developments in psychiatry and consciousness science in decades.
